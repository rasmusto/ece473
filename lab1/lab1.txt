ECE473 Lab1:

Purpose: 
  *Set up OS specific development environment. 
  *See if your AVR tools install was successful.
  *Make sure your AVR board is still working.
  *Get the 473 Lab parts kit. 
  *Get acquainted with AVR-GCC tools.
  *Review C programming/compiling.
  *Get acquainted with downloading code to the uC board.

Task:
  *Set up your laptop with the necessary OS and/or AVR tools as required 
   BEFORE LAB if possible.
  *Attach the programmer to your AVR board and USB port.
  *Download lab1_code.c code and the Makefile into a working directory. 
   Compile with gcc by typing "make all" and see that the compiler is working.
   You should see no errors and a number of files will be produced.
  *Program your mega128 board. Make sure that avrdude and Makefile are 
   properly setup.  This is done with the command "make program".  The
   file "Makefile" contains the instructions to properly compile, link and
   program your board.
  *See that the original code works.  This piece of code counts the number of 
   "S0" button pushes by using the on-board LEDS as a binary display.  Get 
   familiar with the code and understand what is going on there.
  *Now...modify the code so that the S0 pushbutton increments the count 
   as before but the count is displayed as two BCD coded numbers on the 8 
   LEDS. The four lower and upper LEDs will form each digit.  i.e., the LSB
   digit is displayed on LEDS L1-L4, MSB digit on LEDS L5-L8. (mega128.2
   refdes) The count will "roll over" to 0 after 99.

What to show for your work:
  *At the beginning of the next lab period show that you have correctly
   modified the code by demonstration.  You will hand in your code too.
   Print your code out using the utility "a2ps".  i.e.:
   a2ps -P [printer_name] [filename.c]

Grading
  -code functioning correctly 75%
  -code well commented        25%
  -lab weighting = 0.05
